# Traffic-Safety-Apparatus-Detection

The highlight of this project is aimed at having automatic AI based street surveillance
systems that will be able to detect riders bot using protective head gears and by detecting their
number plates as well we will be able to establish an Identity for such riders as well. We plan to
stand out by using the open CV based YOLO model for object detection and also compare it with
the existing CNN models all be it on a small sample size.
The technical functioning of the YOLO model and the methodology used to achieve our aimed
results has been mentioned in the project alongside suggestions of loopholes that can be filled in
the project and the additions that can be made to make this framework more robust and applicable
in the real world.
